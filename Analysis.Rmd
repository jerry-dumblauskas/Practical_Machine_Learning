From the coursera website:

"Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset)."

for this analysis we assume the data is downloaded and in the same directory.


```{r}
library(caret)
local_data_training <- read.csv('pml-training.csv')
local_data_testing <- read.csv('pml-testing.csv')
```

Set up a split on t
```{r}
set.seed(12345)
ts_in <- createDataPartition(y=local_data_training$classe, p=0.7, list=F)
ts_in1 <- local_data_training[ts_in, ]
ts_in2 <- local_data_training[-ts_in, ]

```

Clean up data
```{r}
# nzv (nearly zero)
nzv <- nearZeroVar(ts_in1)
ptrain1 <- ptrain1[, -nzv]
ptrain2 <- ptrain2[, -nzv]

# remove variables that are NA
mostlyNA <- sapply(ptrain1, function(x) mean(is.na(x))) > 0.95
ptrain1 <- ptrain1[, mostlyNA==F]
ptrain2 <- ptrain2[, mostlyNA==F]

# remove variables tthe first five variables (not needed for prediction)
ptrain1 <- ptrain1[, -(1:5)]
ptrain2 <- ptrain2[, -(1:5)]
```






```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
